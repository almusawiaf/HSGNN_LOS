# Length of Stay Prediction with MIMIC-III

This project propose the prediction of **Length of Stay (LoS)** utilizing a heterogeneous graph representation of the MIMIC-III dataset. Along with that, this project implements multiple machine learning models to predict the **Length of Stay (LoS)** for patients using the **MIMIC-III** clinical database. The models include:
- Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Logistic Regression

## Dataset

- **MIMIC-III** is a publicly available critical care database, and it contains de-identified health data of patients.
- Preprocessed and relevant features from patient data (e.g., demographics, diagnoses, vitals, etc.) are used for training and testing.

## Models

The following machine learning models are implemented:

1. **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)**
2. **Random Forest**
3. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
4. **Logistic Regression**
